# Graph Visualiser
A brief project to show off graph theory & Dijkstra's algorithm for seaching the tree.
All elements are fully editable to customise the graph based on your parameters.
It lives updates all onscreen information, including the search algorithm.

Future features to be added as my understanding of the theory evolves.
